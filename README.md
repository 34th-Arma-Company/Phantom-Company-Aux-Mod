## Our Discord Link
If you have stumbled upon our mod and are interested in helping with development, have a question about our mod, or want to join our unit then you may want to join our Discord.
Mod development discussions and our Arma 3 event organisation (aka Operations) happen over there, if you are interested in playing with us then you can join the unit from our Discord too.
[The Discord is currently private, pardon our dust while we set up]
